# hello-world
A project to kickstart my learning of the GitHub platform

Just writing some stuff here to see what happens next. 

I'm currently wroking as a web app developer, using JavaScript and PHP. It's actually my first project, but I'm doing quite well because I spent a good part of my teen years learning how to make webpages and videogames, so I already know HTML, CSS, Lua, GML (Game Maker Language), and a tad of C++.

I'm quite interested in learning to use Unity and Unreal Engine, and a lot of programming languages and all faces that any development project in general (videogame-related or not) may include, such as database administration and even project management itself.
